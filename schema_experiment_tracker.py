The Experiment Name should be short and descriptive, and must be unique. It is meant to be an alternative ID assigned to each experiment relevant to the data package that is human readable and recognizable as related to a specific study experiment or activity. In order to make this both human and machine readable, 1) name must start with a lower case letter, 2) name must end with a lower case letter or number, 3) only characters allowed are lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens (use hyphen instead of space), 4) name has a max length of 50, 5) name must be unique (append an iterable number as a suffix to make unique if necessary; e.g. \"-1\", \"-2\")",
